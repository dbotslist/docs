# Get started
First, install it on your project.
```sh copy
pnpm add @dbots/node
```

Get your api key [here](https://dbotslist.lol/bot/ID) (REPLACE "ID" WITH YOUR ACTUAL BOT'S ID)

And initialize it.
```ts
import { Client as DbotsClient } from "@dbots/node";

const dbotsClient = new DbotsClient({
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
})

const main = async () => {
    await dbotsClient.postGuildCount(/** Your logic here */);
}

main()
```
> This is a mocked example, you may adapt it to your actual code.

That's it! You just posted your bot's guild count to the website!
